    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>Hello, My Name is Tiana and here are some cool things about me!</p><br>
    Three of my all time favorite hobbies are travel, reading, and thrifting.
    <br><br>
    <p>Some of my Favorite places I've traveled to are:</p>
    <Ol>
        <li>England
            <ul>
                <li>Edinburough</li>
                <li>Dublin, Ireland (yes, I know this is in Ireland which is a different country but it was on the same trip; Any Irish please don't come for me.)</li>
                <li>London</li>
                <li>Bath</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Costa Rica</li>
            <ul>
                <li>San Jose</li>
                <li>Puntarenas</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Austria
            <ul>
                <li>Salzburg</li>
                <li>Vienna</li>
                <li>Hallstatt</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </Ol><br><br>
    <p>I also loved to read on my travels a lot. Some of my favorite books have been:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Handmaid's Tale</li>
        <li>Night</li>
        <li>The Host</li>
        <li>The Hunger Games</li>
        <li>Throne Of Glass</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The reading community is really good at leaving reviews on said books and putting them all on multiple platforms; such as Good Reads, literal, and the actual book site itself. This is really useful because sometimes books are advertised much better than they actually are or don't sound that good in the blurb but are actually amazing, so reviews help even that out.</p>
